Users of versions older than v5.69 MUST stop asd before upgrading.
Data loss can occur if you ignore this warning.

Arch Linux users do not need to worry about if asd is installed from the
official PKGBUILD in the AUR. This contains a pre_upgrade scriptlet that
will stop asd for you.

I cannot do this for Ubuntu users building this manually.

You have been warned.
